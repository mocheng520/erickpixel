<b>Welcome</b>

This branch is where I'll put all the Systems that I develop for my RTS Prototype Project. 
Most of it will contains self splanatory comments (xml style), I'm all the way open to suggestions just be polite please. 

I'm still learning game development and Programming (even though I feel I've advanced a lot from where I started). So any tips and advices are appreciated.
